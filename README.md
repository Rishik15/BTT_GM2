# SRI – Predicting and Measuring Grit in Leaders  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Investors often rely on both financial data and leadership qualities when making funding decisions. Leadership plays a critical role in a company’s success, and research shows that “grit”—a combination of perseverance and passion—is a strong predictor of long-term success.  

This project explores methods to estimate grit in individuals, especially leaders (e.g., CEOs), with the ultimate goal of designing a lightweight, data-driven grit survey that can support investment decision-making.

## 🚩 Problem Statement  
We aim to answer two key questions:  
1. **What are the main predictors of grit in an individual?**  
2. **Can we design a survey that reliably estimates whether or not an individual demonstrates grit?**

## 📊 Datasets  
We will leverage well-established psychological datasets:  
- **Duckworth’s Grit Data** – includes grit scores from validated surveys.  
- **Cattell’s 16 Personality Factors Test** – focuses on personality traits; we will pay special attention to “self-reliance” as a proxy for grit.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap  

### **Month 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration (by end of September)**  
- Gather and clean grit-related datasets (resolve missing or inconsistent data).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  - Correlate grit scores with personality traits.  
  - Compare demographic distributions across datasets.  

### **Month 2: ML Model Building & Testing (by end of October)**  
- Train regression and classification models to predict grit.  
- Address class imbalance, particularly for underrepresented groups.  
- Evaluate models with standard metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC) and **bias/fairness metrics**.  
- Use **SHAP values** to identify top predictors of grit.  

### **Month 3: Solution Delivery (by end of November / early December)**  
- Draft a lightweight **grit survey** for use with funding applicants.  
- Build a prototype **Streamlit app** to administer the survey.  
- Deliver a final report summarizing:  
  - Key predictive factors of grit.  
  - Model limitations and generalizability concerns.  
  - Recommendations for future improvements and scaling.
